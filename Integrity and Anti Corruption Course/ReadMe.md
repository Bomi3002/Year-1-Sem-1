## Integriti and Anti Corruption Course : Reflections

This course on UTM's core concepts has been an eye-opener, highlighting the crucial values of Integrity, Synergy, Excellence, and Sustainability (ISES) that are fundamental for addressing the nation's future demands. Learning about the significance of integrity, values, and self-identity in preventing power abuse and corruption has not only broadened my perspective but also instilled a sense of responsibility and awareness in navigating ethical considerations in both personal and organizational contexts.
